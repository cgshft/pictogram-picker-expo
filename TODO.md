# TODOs
1. Check export for correctness and transferablity (universal filenames)
1. Fix problem with app crashing after selecting folder save location
2. Update csv export format to be more verbose and have more descriptive filenames (include source)
3. Fix any ? symbol display errors in app. Israel-flag and Isle-of-Man-flag in Noto Emoji
4. Remove the combined symbol selection logging once no duplication has been confirmed
5. Update style/format of combined selection bottom bar
6. Fix the export api log functionality
7. Chang AACIL to AACIL in frontend (may need to just change it on the API side in current code setup)
8. Update top toolbar dropdown to left align the icons
9.  Check the async loading of ARASAAC and AACIL (might still be grabbing all at once) and add async to flaticon if it is not there
10. Figure out how to add headers to the API call symbols metadata csv
